## PuppetDB 6.9.0

### New features and improvements

- **File indexing on `catalog_resources`.** After you configure the PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` extension, PuppetDB adds an index to the file column on the `catalog_resources` table. [PDB-4640](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4640)
  > **Note:** As of this release, running PostgreSQL without the `pg_trgm` extension is deprecated. 

- **Improved queries.** PuppetDB now has an [experimental query optimizer](./api/query/v4/query#experimental_query_optimization) that may be able to substantially decrease the cost and response time of some queries. [PDB-4512](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4512)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue affecting PE installations where PuppetDB would fail to purge a deactivated node. [PDB-4479](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4479) 

- Database migrations could fail if there were long periods of inactivity in the `resource_events`, table and a client's server wasn't using UTC.[PDB-4641](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4641)


## PuppetDB 6.8.1

### Bug fixes

- Database migrations would fail for timezones with positive UTC offsets. [PDB-4626](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4626)

## PuppetDB 6.8.0

### New features and improvements

- **New `resource-events-ttl` configuration parameter.** Use the
  `resource-events-ttl` configuration parameter to automatically delete report events older
  than the specified time. The parameter rounds up to the nearest day.
  For example, `14h` rounds up to `1d`. For more information, see [Configuring
  PuppetDB](./configure.html#resource-events-ttl).
  [PDB-2487](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-2487)

- **New `delete` command.** Use the `delete` command to immediately delete the
  data associated with a certname. For more information, see [Commands
  endpoint](./api/admin/v1/cmd.html#delete-version-1). [PDB-3300](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3300)

### Bug fixes

- Resolved an issue where an unreachable
  PostgreSQL server could cause PuppetDB to exhaust its connection pool,
  requiring a restart.
  [PDB-4579](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4579)

### Bug fixes

- This release includes various security improvements.

### Contributors

Austin Blatt, Ethan J. Brown, Heston Hoffman, Markus Opolka, Morgan
Rhodes, and Nate Wolfe

## PuppetDB 6.7.2

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused PuppetDB to shut down if the initial Postgres
  connection failed. PuppetDB now retries the connection if it fails.

Wolfe, Rob Browning, Robert Roland, and Zak Kent

## PuppetDB 6.7.1

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where PuppetDB terminated a migration with a Postgres exception
  if `standard_conforming_strings` was not set to `true`. PuppetDB now verifies
  the setting before checking if any migrations are necessary. [PDB-4509](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4509)  

- Fixed a bug that prevented command size metrics from being recorded and the
  `max-command-size` config option from working properly.
  [PDB-4502](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4502)
  
- This release restores the cipher suites required to connect to Puppet Server using
  TLS versions TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. [PDB-4513](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4513)

## PuppetDB 6.7.0

### New features and improvements

- **Debian 10 support** - PuppetDB packages are now available for Debian 10. These packages require Java 11 to be installed, rather than Java 8. [PDB-4469](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4469)  

- **New `ignored` metric.** The `ignored` metric tracks the number of obsolete
  commands since the last restart. For more on the `ignored` metric, see
  [Metrics endpoint][metrics]. [PDB-4278](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4278)

- **Return a specific fact or resource paramater with `inventory` and `resources` endpoints.** You can now use dot notation
  with `inventory` and `resources` endpoints to return a specific fact or resource parameter instead of the
  entire JSON file [PDB-2634](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-2634). 
  
  For examples of using dot notation in PQL and AST, see the following: 
  - [Puppet Query Language (PQL) examples](./api/query/examples-pql.markdown) 
  - [AST query language (AST)](./api/query/v4/ast.markdown)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where PQL queries with dot notation required an extra
  space to terminate the dotted field. For example, `inventory[]{
  facts.os.family="Debian" }` would fail because PuppetDB parsed the `=` operator as part of the dotted field. [PDB-3284](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3284)

## PuppetDB 6.6.0

### Bug fixes

- A change in the `puppetdb-termini` package for 6.5.0 broke SSL connections that
  did not use Puppet's CA. This fix adds [the `verify_client_certificate` configuration option][puppet_apply].
  By default, `verify_client_certificate` only allows SSL connections authenticated by the
  Puppet CA. When set to `false`, it allows the use of other SSL connections. [PDB-4487](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4487)

- Fixed an issue where package upgrades on CentOS 6 would sometimes fail when
  upgrading from older versions of PuppetDB (for example, 5.2) to more recent versions
  (for example, 6.3+). [PDB-4373](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4373)

## PuppetDB 6.5.0

### New features and improvements

- **New experimental `catalog-input-contents` endpoint.** Use the [`catalog-input-contents`](./api/query/v4/catalog_input_contents.markdown) endpoint to query for the most recent
catalog inputs that PuppetDB has received for any nodes. ([PDB-4371](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4371)

- **Submit `inputs` to a catalog.** PuppetDB can now optionally store "inputs", such as Hiera keys, during catalog compilation. See the [command's wire format](puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/wire_format/catalog_inputs_format_v1.md) for more information on how to submit them. [PDB-4372](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4372)

### Bug fixes

 - We've updated the default auto-vacuum settings for several tables which PuppetDB was vacuuming more frequently than neccessary. These changes will apply once at the next upgrade. [PDB-3745](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3745)

## PuppetDB 6.4.0

### Bug fixes

- This bug affects Puppet Enterprise (PE) only. After a restart or downtime, PuppetDB did not sync its package inventory, resulting in PuppetDB nodes with desynced fact hashes. [PDB-4266](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4266)
